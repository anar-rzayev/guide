## Introduction

First of all I want to say that expressed opinions are my own and I am just delegating the information 
already known from the Internet, however it still may be useful for students who consider asking for a referral. Referrals are a common practice in tech companies for hiring new people. Here I will briefly explain about referrals in Google, however some of the advice also can apply to other companies as well.


## FAQ

### Q. What is referral?

A. In simple words, it is just a recommendation for hiring a certain candidate. People who know you well, might *refer* you to their recruiters, so that recruiters might get more interest in your application, then if you just applied by yourself.

### Q. Why referral is important?

A. Actually it is not **that** important, because you will still go standard procedures of hiring aka - interviews, onsites, surveys and etc. BUT it is a sure way that your resume will be considered at least. Companies have to deal with a HUGE number of resumes coming each year and the number is growing. It was said that recruiters spend around [6 seconds](https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-recruiters-look-at-during-the-6-seconds-they-spend-on-your-resume-2012-4?utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=topbar) on your resume. So, it is very hard to stand out (almost impossible), and getting referral just maximizes the chances that your resume will be given more than 6 seconds.

### Q. Whom can I get referral from?

A. In Google, referral can be taken from any full-time worker, even from an intern. 
You can even take referral from an employee who is in different office from the one that you are applying for.

### Q. From whom should I get a referral?

A. This question is a bit different from the above one. You can get referral from any Google employee but the question is: From whom should I get a referral, to maximize my chances? As a rule of thumb, you should take a referral from an employee who know you well - better if they worked with you directly. If you have several such connections, then you are lucky enough to choose. In this case, I would suggest to take a referral from a person who is higher up in corporate ladder, ex: it's better to take referral from senior engineer than an intern.

### Q. What is the process of referral?

A. In Google process of referral is simple: 

1. Your acquitance at Google fills a survey in an internal system about you, describing you and your strengths. One might need a personal data about you like your resume, your email and your name.
1. You get an email invitation that you calls you to apply to positions at Google. **You have 30 days to accept the invitation.**
1. When you accept an invitation, you have another **30 days** to apply to atmost 3 positions at [Google Careers](https://careers.google.com/) website. Note that you just need to apply without doing any extra steps - **referral will be automatically activated once you accept the invitation**.

### Q. What's next?

A. Wait for the reply! If you are called for an interview - Congratulations! you passed the resume screening. If not, don't worry, it is ok to get rejected. Speaking from personal experience, I myself haven't entered from the first try.

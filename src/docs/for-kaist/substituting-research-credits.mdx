title: 'Substituting research credits'
---

KAIST requires students to complete 3 Research Credits. It means that you have to participate in some research program and usually students choose Individual Study to close these requirements in order to graduate. However, you can also complete these requirements by doing an internship, which in my opinion is a huge plus. In order to recognize the credits you have to fill some forms and talk with a professor who is in charge of internships from your department. 

Here is the past email from ISSS about internship application, along with some of the attached documents. 

- [Email (pdf)](documents/isss-internship-email.pdf)
- [Application form for Alien registration (doc)](documents/app_form_for_alien_registration.doc)
- [Guideline for proof of residence for KAIST students living in dorms (pdf)](documents/guideline_proof_of_residency_kaist.pdf)
- [Recommendation for part time (doc)](documents/recommendation_for_part_time.doc)

> **IMPORTANT**: Documents above just provide you with an overview of what you have to do for paperwork if you plan to do an internship and get credits for it. At this very time you read this webpage these documents may be outdated and you better contact ISSS to send you an email regarding internship.
